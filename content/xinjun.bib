  abstract={We performed experiments in which tearing pieces of plastic produced a fractal boundary. Similar patterns are commonly observed at the edges of leaves. These patterns can be reproduced by imposing metrics upon thin sheets. We present an energy functional that provides a numerical test-bed for this idea, and derive a continuum theory from it. We find ordinary differential equations that provide minimum energy solutions for long thin strips with linear gradients in metric, and verify both numerically and experimentally the correctness of the solutions.},

abstract ={The buckling of hyperelastic incompressible cylindrical tubes of arbitrary length and thickness under compressive axial load is considered within the framework of nonlinear elasticity. Analytical and numerical methods for bifurcation are developed using the exact solution of Wilkes for the linearized problem within the Stroh formalism. Using these methods, the range of validity of the Euler buckling formula and its first nonlinear corrections are obtained for third-order elasticity. The values of the geometric parameters (tube thickness and slenderness) where a transition between buckling and barrelling is observed are also identified.},

  abstract={In many cylindrical structures in biology, residual stress fields are created through differential growth. In particular, if the outer and inner layers of a cylinder grow differentially, parts of the cylinder will be in a state of axial compression and other parts will be in tension. These tissue tensions change the overall material properties of the structure. Here, we study the role of tissue tension in the overall rigidity and stability of the cylinder. A detailed analysis, based on nonlinear elasticity, of the effect of tissue tension on the mechanical properties of growing cylinders reveal a subtle interplay between geometry, growth, and nonlinear elastic responses that help understand some of the remarkable properties of stems and other biological tissues.}
